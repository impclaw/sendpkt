# Sendpkt
Sends a packet on an interface, and monitors all interfaces listed for a response. Prints all repsonses to stdout so they can be examined. Useful quick tool to test network device low level behavior. I usually manually recreate a similar script over and over every time I test a new network program, so I thought it appropriate to save a version for future use.
